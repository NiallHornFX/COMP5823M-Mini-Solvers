#### COMP5823M : Animation & Simulation - Projects

###### Niall Horn - University Of Leeds (2021)

#### Summary

This repository contains 3 projects which I completed as coursework for COMP5823M. These are based around the topic animation and simulation within computer graphics. This module was taken during my MSc at University of Leeds in 2021-2022. 

Due to my prior experience in this domain, I found the scope of these projects quite trivial. However I used this as a chance to try and write, three clean and efficient applications. 

#### Projects

Each project has a `README.md` which provides more details about their original papers, algorithms used and implementation into C++ code. 

* **Kinematic Viewer:** A utility to view BVH motion capture data, using forward kinematics.
* **Cloth Solver:** A Mass-Spring based cloth solver, with real-time rendering. 
* **2D Fluid Solver:** A 2D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) fluid solver, with Wyvill/Gaussian based metaball surfacing.
